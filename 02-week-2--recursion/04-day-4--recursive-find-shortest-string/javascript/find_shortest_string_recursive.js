// Please add your pseudocode to this file
/*
  -if arr has no elements, return an empty string
  -if arr only has one element. return that element
  -else remove the first element of arr, and set it to a variable *firstElement
  -iterate through the remaining elements of arr testing each of their string lengths against the firstElements string length
  -if some of them are less, run the function again passing in the shortened arr
  -else return firstElement
*/
// And a written explanation of your solution
/*
  I knew I had to shorten the length of arr with each recursion and use the first elements length as the test case for the remaining
  elements lengths.  If there was ever a time when no elements left in arrs lengths were less than the first (removed) element, I
  would return that first element since it would be the shortest string.  If there were elements with less characters in the string
  I would repeat the function over again until the first element was that of the shortest string.
